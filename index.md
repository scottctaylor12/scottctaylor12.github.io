![image of scott](/images/scott.png) My name is Scott Taylor and I am a security professional studying the dark art of information security.
As I learn more about cybersecurity, I will [post](https://scottctaylor12.github.io/posts/) more articles on this blog.

## Background

I started this journey by enrolling in the [Cisco Networking Academy](https://www.netacad.com/) while in high school. 
Through this program, I learned the fundamentals of networking such as IPv4 addressing, routing protocols, OSI and TCP/IP models, and network device configuration. 
After a year of studying network fundamentals on a daily basis, I passed the [Cisco Certified Entry-Level Network Technician](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications/entry/ccent.html) (CCENT) certification.  

From there, I went on to complete my B.S. in Information Technology from [Towson University](https://www.towson.edu/fcsm/departments/computerinfosci/undergrad/infotech/). 
This program covered many areas of IT including system administration, databases, web development, and project management. 
This was helpful to gain exposure in the various areas of IT.

During my time at Towson University, I interned with [Aplura, LLC](https://www.aplura.com) where I worked as a Linux system administrator. 
Starting from no experience, I was pushed to learn Linux which was the best thing that could have happened to me. 
Within 8 months of working with the company, I passed the [Red Hat Certified System Administrator](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/ex200-red-hat-certified-system-administrator-rhcsa-exam) (RHCSA) exam. 
Along with the RHCSA, I passed the [CompTIA Security+](https://certification.comptia.org/certifications/security) and [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/view/education/SP-CAAAJER) certifications. 
During the final months of the internship, I passed the [Red Hat Certified Engineer](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/ex300-red-hat-certified-engineer-rhce-exam) (RHCE) certification to solidify my knowledge of Red Hat system administration.

After graduating from Towson University, I accepted a full time position with [The MITRE Corporation](https://www.mitre.org/) focusing on security engineering and expanding my knowledge on the subject. 
I started digging into offensive security and passed the [Offensive Security Certified Professional](https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/) (OSCP) certification exam.
While at MITRE, I also had the opportunity to lead a small offensive development team that built MITRE's automated adversary emulation framework, [CALDERA](https://github.com/mitre/caldera).

You can find me at random capture-the-flag events and conferences including BSides [Charm](http://www.bsidescharm.com/) & [DC](http://www.bsidesdc.org/) and [ShmooCon](https://shmoocon.org/) in the DMV area.
