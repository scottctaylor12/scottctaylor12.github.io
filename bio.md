My name is Scott Taylor and I am a security apprentice studying the dark art of information security.  

I started this journey by enrolling in a [Cisco Networking Academy](https://www.netacad.com/) while in high school. Through this program, I learned the fundamentals of networking such as IPv4 addressing, routing protocols, OSI and TCP/IP models, and network device configuration. After a year of studying this networking fundamentals daily, I passed the [Cisco Certified Entry-Level Network Technician](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications/entry/ccent.html) (CCENT) certification.  

From there, I completed my B.S. in Information Technology from [Towson University](https://www.towson.edu/fcsm/departments/computerinfosci/undergrad/infotech/). This program covered many areas of IT including system administration, databases, web development, and project management. This was helpful to gain exposure in the various areas of IT.

During my time at Towson University, I interned with [Aplura, LLC](https://www.aplura.com) where I was a Linux system administrator. This pushed me to learn Linux starting from no background which is the best thing that could have happened to me. Within 8 months of working with the company, I passed the [Red Hat Certified System Administrator](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/ex200-red-hat-certified-system-administrator-rhcsa-exam) (RHCSA) exam. Along with the RHCSA, I passed the [CompTIA Security+](https://certification.comptia.org/certifications/security) and [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/view/education/SP-CAAAJER) certifications. During the final months of the internship, I passed the [Red Hat Certified Engineer](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/ex300-red-hat-certified-engineer-rhce-exam) (RHCE) certification to solidify my knowledge of Red Hat system administration.

After graduating from Towson University, I started working full time with [The MITRE Corporation](https://www.mitre.org/) focusing on security engineering and expanding my knowledge on the subject.  

Each day I learn more and more and this is my place to keep those thoughts. You can find me at conferences such as BSides [Charm](http://www.bsidescharm.com/) & [DC](http://www.bsidesdc.org/) and [ShmooCon](https://shmoocon.org/) in the DMV area.
